# FreeTunes

Freely enjoy your tunes across the web :)

## Installation

1. Run the python installer and do the default installation settings.
2. Inside an empty space in the folder, hold shift and press right click.
3. A menu should pop up and one of the options should be `open powershell window here`
4. Click that option and it should open up powershell with the directory set to the folder.
5. Now open `requirements.txt` and copy the text from the file.
6. Paste it into powershell and hit enter. This should begin installing selenium for python
which is needed for the program to work.
7. After the installation is finished, run this command `python browser.py`.
8. This should now open up another Chrome.
9. With this Chrome you will now be able to install any Chrome extensions (like kproxy), to let
you freely surf the web. You can also x out the message saying that Chrome is being automated.

### Important

- *Make sure to keep powershell open in order for Chrome to work*
- **After chrome closes, all data will be erased and you will have to reinstall extensions and re sign in to any websites**
- ***IF ANY ERRORS ARISE DURING INSTALLATION, THIS WILL NOT WORK***
